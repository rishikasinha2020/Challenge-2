Overview of Project: 

    Steve loves the workbooks. At the click of a button, he can analyze an entire dataset. Now, to do a little more research for his parents, he wants to expand the dataset to include the entire stock market over the last few years. Although the code works well for a dozen stocks, it might not work as well for thousands of stocks. And if it does, it may take a long time to execute.

    In this project, i’ll edit, or refactor, the Module 2 solution code to loop through all the data one time in order to collect the same information that you did in this module. Then, i’ll determine whether refactoring the code successfully made the VBA script run faster. Finally, i’ll present a written analysis that explains my findings.

    Refactoring is a key part of the coding process. When refactoring code, you aren’t adding new functionality; you just want to make the code more efficient—by taking fewer steps, using less memory, or improving the logic of the code to make it easier for future users to read. 

Results: 

    Refer to VBA_Challenge_ 2017.png and VBA_Challenge_ 2018.png under resources folder to visiualize the stocks trend and code performance for year 2017 and 2018.
    Refer to VBCode under developer tab within the VBA_Challenge.xlsm to review my refactored code.
    
    In the year, 2017 stock for TERP had a negetive return. It does not show a good return on investment.

    In the year, 2018 except stocks for ENPH and RUN, all other stocks had a negetive returns. 

    Overall the year 2018, does not trend like a good year for many stocks under analysis.

Summary: 

    Refactoring the code gives advantage in tiem spent on analysis of data.

    Pros:
        An efficient code takes less time in analysing a large data set. 
        Code efficiency may not be visible in smaller dataset, however it makes or breaks the analysis when dataset is realworld and large.
        Effient code uses less resources of the computer effienctly - Like - Memory, RAM etc.

    Cons:
        An less efficient code takes long time in analysing a large data set. 
        Code efficiency may not be visible in smaller dataset, however it makes or breaks the analysis when dataset is realworld and large.
        Effient code uses more resources of the computer effienctly - Like - Memory, RAM etc.
